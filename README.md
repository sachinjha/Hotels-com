hotels-event-create pipeline and hotels-onboarding-ui pipeline require API\_KEY  and API\_SECRET in order to make the API calls to generate events for onboarding of hotels. These values can be obtained by registering as a consumer in API Connect developer portal and subscribing to the Events API. 

Once the API\_KEY  and API\_SECRET values are obtained, one should update the configuration parameters in Deploy Stages of these pipelines and restart them. This will successfully deploy the openwhisk actions and onboarding-ui application.
